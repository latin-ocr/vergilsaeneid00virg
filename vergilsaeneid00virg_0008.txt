His semies Vergil began his studies at Cremona, where, we are told,
Ξὲθὲ’ὸ he assumed the tegla virilis on the same day on which -
Lucretius died. The town itself had already been noted,

having been the birthplace of Furius Bibaculus, and of the
critic, Quinctilius Varro.

Vena noe-s· After a brief stay at Cremona, and subsequently at Medio-

to Rom‘e, lanum (Milan), the poet went to Rome. In the capital,

B.C¹.53. Vergil, after the fashion of the day, attended the lectures
of rhetoricians and philosophers. Under Epidius, the rhe-
torician‚ the teacher of Marc Antony and afterwards of
Octavius, and under the Epicurean philosopher, Siron, the
poet became acquaiuted with the outlines of rhetoric and
philosophy. It is quite probable that his father intended him
for the bar, but a weak voice and a diffident manner were in-
superable barriers in tne way of obtaining distinction in
public speaking. Vergil soon gave up rhetoric, and, in fact,
renounced poetry sor the more congenial study of philosophy.
Under Siron, he seems to have made considerable progress'in
Epicurean philosophy, and the love he retained for this branch
of learning is plainly observable in many of his extant
writings.4 In a minor poem, generally supposed to be genuine,
he weleomes the exchauge of poetry and rhetoric for more
useful studies: Α

“Away with you, empty coloured flagons of the rhetori-
cians, words swollen, bnt not with the dews of Greece; and,
away with you, Stilo, 'sagitius and Varro, you, nation oi
pedants, soaking with fat: you, empty cymbala of tlie class-
room. Farewell‚ too, Sabinus, friend of all my friends ; now,
farewell, all my beautiful companions, we are setting our
sails for a haven of bliss, going to hear the learned words oi
the great Siron, and we mean to redeem our life from al]
distraction. Farewell‚ too, sweet Muses3 for, to tell the
trutla„ I have found how sweet you were: and yet, I pray
you look ou my pages again, but with modesty and at rare
intervals. ”⁵

an to After a short stay at Rome, Vergil probably went to Naples,
Nivjzles. where, we are told, Parthenius, another Epicurean, was his
„mwucton 'l'he great Epic-⁶ of Lucretius, added to the
