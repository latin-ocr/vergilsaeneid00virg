same subject that has ever appeared. The harmonious and §Zanes of

’ the apt and chat-ming episodes, all combine to lend an

interest to a subject, which in any other hands would have

been intolerably dull. Tne time was ripe for such a poem.

Agriculture had bn en the chief employment and the honored

occupation of the Romans from the early days of the

city. The long-continued wars had, however, desolated

Italy‚²¹ and Vergil with sorrow laments, “the plough hath

not its meed of honor, the fields lie neglected, and the

tillet-s are off to the war; the crooked pruning hooks are

forged into stiff sw0.ds.'’2² Even after war had ceased, the

soldier, too long aoeustomed to cainps and the excitement of a

military life, cared little about the prosaic life of a farmer.

To recall the peaeeful habits of rural industry, the poem,

which Addison pronounces “the most complete, elaborate

and finished piece of all antiquity‚’' was written. The first eante-atses

book treats of tillage, the second of orchards, the third of the Gemma·

care of horses and cattle, and the fourth of bees. The two

most successful imitations in English of this poem are Philips's

Pastorals, and Thompson’s Seno-ons. Yet, no one ean read

the English imitations without being struck with their in-

feriority to the poem of Vergil.

The Aeneid‚²³ in twelve books, written between 29 ΒΟ. Aeneia.

and 19 B.C.‚ recounts the story of the escape of Aeneas from

burning Troy, his wanderings over the deep in search of a.

home which the fates had promised, his final settlement in

Italy as the founder of the Roman Empire destined iu after

ages to rulc the world. No doubt, Vergil, horrowed largely

from the Greek and Roman writers who preceded him. The Ver-‘fil

Romans were original in no department of literature, except Ξξὲὗῖἕῇῑὸᾝή

”The first notice ot the Aeneid that we have is in a letter of Vergil to Augustus,
mque„ probably B.C. 26, when the latter was on an expedition against the Canta-
brians. De Aenea quidem msto, si mehercule jam diynum auribus haberem luis, libenter
