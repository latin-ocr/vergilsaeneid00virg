Theocritus Vergil's Eclogues‚ on the other hand, can hardly be said to
ῗέζζξ Ξξζῦῐι be true pictures of pastoral life. His shepherds and shep-
1> ⁸ herdesses belong to the island of Sicily rather than to the
district of Mantua. 0fteu, too, he makes the shepherd's
dress a mere pretext for discussing some political event, οι· for
paying some compliment to Pollio, Varro, or Gallus. His
characters are too cmwentional, his representation of lise is
too artificial. In the Roman Eclogue we miss that individu-
alizing the character which so strongly marks the Greek
Idyl. Still the earlier poems of Vergil have beauties. Their
melodicus diction, their soft and easy flowing style‚¹⁶ were

admired by Horace, no mean judge of the poet's art.

Dim'sion os Dunlop divides the Eclogues into two classes: (1) those in

E¹³l⁰9¹⁴⁶³· which, by a sort of allegory‚ some events or characters of ³
the time are drawn under the image of pastoral life as in l,
4,‘5, 1οε (2) those in which shepherds and rural soenes are
really depicted, as in 2, 3, 6, 7, S, 9. Others divide them:
(1) those copied from Theocritus, fil, 2, 3, 5, ⁴7, 8, 9 2 (2)
those more original, as 4, 6, 10.

The Georyics The GeorgyIcs,¹⁷ in four books, was written (between B.C.
37-B.C. 30¹⁸) at the request of Maecenas¹⁹ to whom the
poem was dedicated. In this didactic Epic, Vergil copies
largely from Hesiod, Nicander, and Aratus.²⁰ While the
Eclogues have justly been regarded as inferior to the Idyls of
hjs Greek original, Theocritus, the Georgics, on the other
hand, have been accounted superior to any other poem 011 the
