1÷Arma viruquoe cano: “I sing of arms and the man.'' Vergil
observes the custom of epic poets by announcing his subject at the
outset: cp. the opening lines of the Iliad, Odyssey and Paradise
Lost.—oerma may be used here to show the eontrast between the
subject of the Aeneid and that the Georgics (cp. the opening line
of Georgic 1.)‚ in which the theme, viz., the occupations ot rustic lise,
is announcedffvirum, referring to the deeds of Aeneas. Distin-
guish Q and edna—qui—lz'ttora : “ who of old from the coasts of
Troy came, an effi? of sate, to Italy and the shore of Laviniuni.”—
primus: Heyne and Wagner, finding a difficulty in reconciling
the usual meaning of this with the statement os Antenor's previous
settlement, mentioned v. 242, make primuszolitn. “ of old.'’

Effizhnylm'v, the lanfflvered by the breakers of the sea3 ripa:

Shaks. Julius Caesar 1, 2: “But ere we could arrive tlte spot

instr. ; or (2) with venit, abl. manner. In what compound words
is pro short? H. 594.5; Α. & G. 354, d.—Lavinaque: others
rea-l Laviniaque. In scansion, if the latter reading is adopted, i is
consonantal‚ i. e. pronounced y. ζῶ

3-5—Ille-Latio: “hard driven on land and on the deep by the violence os
heaven, sor cruel Juno's unsorgetsul anger, and hard bestead in war
also, ere he might found a city and carry his gods into Latium.''—

Latium in prose.

6—Unde=a quo, scil., ortum est: “from whom (sprung).’' Some think
