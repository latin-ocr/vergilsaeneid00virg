METRE OF THE AENEID.

(4) The last word in a dactylic hexameter line is for the
most part a dissyllable,⁸¹ or a trisyllable. A quadrisyllable is
rarely allowed, excepb in the case of a proper name. Some-
times, but rarely, a monosyllable is employed at the end of a

line, and generally in the case of est, and then usually with
an elision: B. Ι. 105.

(5) Metrical flaures:

(a) Eli-sion occurs when a word ending in a vowel οι· diph-
thong, or with the letter, -m preceded by a vowel and the
following word begins with a vowel, diphthong, or the letter
h. When such is the case the lass: syllable of the word so
ending with a vowel, diphthong, or sshe lether -m preceded by

a vowel is elided, i.e., struck out together, and in scansion is Ι

noi: regarded as a part of the verse, e. g.
