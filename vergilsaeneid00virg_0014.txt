perhaps in the departnients of History and Jurisprndence.
Vergil can hardly be called a borrower any inore than the rest
of his countrymen in other spheres of letters. The religion,
the philosophy, the very politieal life of the Romans, were
all of composite structure, and poetry could scarcely avoid
the eclectieisni that everywhere prevailed. The object of
Vergil was to produce a natioual epic, by showing the vari-
ous steps of the growth of the Empire, and in doing this,
he had to give pronum—nee to the influeuce of Greek litera-
ture as an important element in meulding Roman thought.

Vergil had been severely censured²4 for his defieiency in
the power 01⁴ invention, for his intel-mixture of Greek and
Latin traditions, for his anachronisms, for his mode of re-
presenting the character of Aeneas, and for the sameness of
the individual chazaeters. 'lhese are the main charges
brought- by his detractore, and. granting the full indICtment
brought against the poem, Vergil stin has the proud claim
of being one of the greatest of epie poete. No doubt his
power of invention is less than Homer's, no doubt he did
intermingle the traditions of Greeee and those of Rome, (for
this, as we have remarked, could hardly be otherwise in his
age), no doubt he ‹lid commit the heincus crime of anachron-
ism, buthe sins in this along with Shakespeare and Milton,
aud there is no doubt that this hero Aeneas is cold—blooded
and uninteresting. These defects, however, are far more
than counterbalanced by his many excellencies. ἡ There is
in Vergil a great tenderness of feeling, something better and
more eharming than mere Roman virtue or morality. That
he excels in pathos, as Homer in sublimity, is an old
opinion, and it is surely the right one, This pathos is given
at times by a single epithet, by a slight touch, with gracesul
art by an indireclz allusion ; this tenderness is more striking
as contrasted with the stern lloman character and with the
stately majesty of the verse. The poet never becomes
affected or sentiinenta13 he hardly ever ofiends againt good
‘caste 3 he knows where to stop 3 he is excellent in his silence
as well as in his speech3 Vergil, as Wordsworth says, is a
master of language, but no one can really be a master of
language unless he be also a master of thought of which
language is the expression. ⁸
