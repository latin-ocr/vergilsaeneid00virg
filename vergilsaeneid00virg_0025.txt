CON'I'EN'I'S OF THE FIRST BOOK OF AENElD. 23

The toil-worn crew of Aeneas make for the nearest shores, The wem-y
and turn to the coasts of Africa. There is a bay, protected {RQ-⁷135?-
by an island, affording a safe shelter from every wind, and in 179.
this Aeneas takes refuge, with seven ships saved out of
twenty. The weary Trojans land. Achates strikes a spark
from the flint and tries to start a fire. The corn damaged
by the waves is brought out of the vessels, and bruised to

make a meal for the shipwrecked Trojans.

Aeneas, in the meantime, mounted a cliff in hopes of seeing Aeneas
some of the tempest—tossed ships that he had missed. No ,Ψόζῖἶηζεζῑω
vessel is in sight. He espies, however, three stags, eaeh fol· datr]- ⁸h⁰⁰t8
lowed by a lierd of deer, on the shore. Seizing a bow and 22²2&ssss
arrows from his trusty henchman Achates, he lays low seven ”umberme
of the deer. He returns to the harbor and divides the ξτῖγὲῧῗιῗίηρ
number equally among the ships—one to each. He also dis· {QZ-'⁸' 180-
tributes the wine which kind Acestes had given to the
Trojans as they were leaving Sicily. With words of cheer
he bids his comrades bear up under their hardships. They
then prepare the meal and enjoy their repast, after which

they talk for a long time of the fate of their lost comrades.

that she shall yet behold the Trojan Aeneas wage a great 223-250. ⁰
