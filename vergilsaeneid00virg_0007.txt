aens or elan, and thesi-rmum. Thus in Publius Veryiliw Maro, Publius is the praeno-
men, mai-king the mic‘m'du il: l'eryzlius is the nomen, denoting the qens or elan ; while
Iluro is the cofmome‘n, or family name. Sometimes an αφιοτηση was added for honor-
ary distinction, as Africanus to Scipio, Numidicus to Metellus. The original form ot
the name was Vergilius; Virgilius was not common till the middle ages.
