renders these lines :—

Deep in a bay an island makes
A haven by itsjutting sides,
Wherein each wave from Ocean breaks,
And, parting, into hollows glideS.
High o'er the cove vast rocks extend,
A beetling cliff at either end:
Beneath their summits far and wide,
In sheltered silence sleeps the tide,
While quivering sorests crown the scene—
A theatre of glancing green.
