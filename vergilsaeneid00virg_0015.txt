poem, carrying on the lines of thought, the style of speech,

‚ which national progress had chosen 3 and it was not meant to

eclipse, so much as to do honor to, early literature. Thus
those bards who, like Ennius and Naevius, had done good
service to Rome by singing, however rudely, her history, find
their imayines ranged in the gallery of the Aeneid. Thus
they meet with the flamens and pontiffs, who drew up the
ritual formularies3 with the antiquarians and pious scholars,

origin. “Augustus is evidently typified under the character
of Aeneas, both are cautious and wise in counsel; both are
free from the perturbations of passion ; they were cold, un-
feeling, and uninteresting; their wisdom and policy were
worldly·minded and calculating. Augustus was conscious
that he was acting a part, as his last words show ; and the
contrast between the sentiment and conduct of Aeneas, when·
ever the warm impulses of affection might be supposed to
have sway, likewise created an impression of insincerity.
The characteristic virtue which adorns the hero of the Aeneid
as the epithet pius, so constantly applied to him shows was
filial piety, and there was no virtue which Augustus more
