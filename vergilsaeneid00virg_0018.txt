via: the dactylic hexameter. This was the most ancient as
well as the most dignified form of verse among the Greeks
and Romans. It was cultivated at an early period, far
beyond the beginnings of authentic history, as we find it in
its most perfect shape in the poems of Homer aud Hesiod,
and the responses of the Delphic oracle. Ennius is said to
have discarded the rude Saturnian metre of his predecessore,
and to have introduced the hexameter among the Romans.

Vergil is generally considered as the model of this kind of
verse among the Latius.

The dactylic hexameter consists, as its name implies of six
feet, the first four of which may be dactyls or spondees ; the

fifth is usually dactyl, and the sixth invariably a spondee.
The following is the scheme :
— U U

υυυυυ υ

- - l- - s- -1
(1) For the comparative number of dactyls and spondees in

the first four places no definite rule can be given. Generally

speaking, the line is more smooth when the arrangement is

varied to avoid monotony. A succession of dactyle may be
used for various reasons, e. g.‚ quick motion, cp. B. I. 90.

where the quick flashes of lightning and the instant peals of
thunder fall in quick succession.

So in B. I· 150 ε
Jamque* sciolis etl εᾶπῖἰ υόξῖᾶηε βῠνόνί ‹iv-md minlistrdt:
where the quick succession of brands and stones follow.

On the other hand a succession of spondees may be em.
ployed to describe a laboured effort: cp. B. I. 118.

Impar-ient rcilri ηᾶπεΙέε inl ρᾶνρῖιέΙ vasta
Here the slow spondees mark the struggling motions of the
crew amid the waves.

So also a dignified gait may be imitated by successive
spondees: Β. Ι. 46.
