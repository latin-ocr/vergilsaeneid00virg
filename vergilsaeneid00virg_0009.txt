teachings of his instructore gave, no doubt, his mind a strong

bent towards the doctrines of Epicurus. It is probable that ·

the poet returned to his father's farm before the outbreak of Returm
the war between Pompey and Caesar, Rc. 49. It is also likely ho‘mae.
that he remained there till after the battle of Philippi (8.0.

42), and that he 'employed his time in gaining by observation
materiale which he afterwards employed in his great didactic

poem, the Georgics. Unlike Horace, Vergil sympathized

with the party of Caesar. The formation of the Second
Triumvirate threw the Roman world into the broils of a civil

war. In the division of the provinces, the Gauls (except

Gallia Narbonensis) fell to Antony. The lands of eighteen

cities were given up to reward the legions of the unscrupu-

lons Antony, and among the lands were those of Cremona.

The district aronnd this city failing to satisfy the greedy

rapacity of the legionaries of the Triumvir, the farms of the
neighbouring Mantua were seized, and among the lands co-n

fiscated were those of the poet's father, C. Asinius Pollio, ,[1ζῇἶὶοῘ '¹¹⁸
the prefect of Gallia T-ffiranspadant unable to restrain the
lawlessness of the soldiers of Antony, sent Vergil to Rome

with a recommendation to Augustus to allow the poet to

retain his paternal estate It is quite probable that con· R

genial tastes aud a recwiition of the genius of Vergil may saeroaem hix
have influenced Pollio to take this course. At the close of

the same year (41 B.C.)‚ however, war broke out anew
between Octavius and L. Antonius. Pollio, was deposed from

office, and Alfenus Varus appointed in his stead. Another

division of lands followed, and the poet is said to have been
deprived of his estate th( second time. ⁷ His friends Gallus, ᾓφῇἰοῶεηέδ n ι
Pollio, and Farus, however, inteiposed and saved his farm. sam·

By them he was introduced to Maecenas, the patron of

literary men—afterwards the prime minister of Augustus.

This· year mark s the beginning of the rising fortunes of theB 0- 40-
poet. With his friend and patr‚on Pollio, as Consul, νεῑὲϋχοηωῖεε ⁰s
became the honoured member of a literary coterie which Veryil.
graced the table of Maecenas. The intimacy that Vergil

enjoyed at court, is shewn by his being one of those who v

went to Brundisium along with Maecenas, when the latter

was negotiating a treaty between Augustus and Antony.⁸
